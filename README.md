# Sample Product Catalog Ingestion Library
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cacsar/product-catalog-sample.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cacsar/product-catalog-sample)


##Purpose

This library and repository serve as sample code resulting from the take home 
assignment of a certain potential employer. Thus while it presents a view into 
the author's coding style and practices at the time of writing, this should not 
be considered a maintained project. It is unlikely that this library will be of
use in a production environment.

##Build Instructions

Builds are done with maven, thus `mvn package`
